## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here).
##Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	i <- NULL
	set <- function(y) {
		x <<- y
		i <<- NULL
	}
	get <- function() x
	setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
	getInverse <- function() i
	list(set = set, get = get,
		setInverse = setInverse,
		getInverse = getInverse)
}

##The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the makeCacheMatrix function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the cacheSolve function.

## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
	i <- x$getInverse()
	if(!is.null(i)) {
		message("getting cached data")
		return(i)
	}
	data <- x$get()
	i <- solve(data, ...)
	x$setInverse(i)
	i
}
